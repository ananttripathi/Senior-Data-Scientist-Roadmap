# Applied Statistics for Data Science & ML

Statistics is the foundation of machine learning. This module supplements Phase 1 with applied statistical concepts used daily in data science.

## 📋 Topics Overview

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- **Measures of centrality:** Mean, median, mode
- **Measures of spread:** Variance, standard deviation, IQR
- **Distributions:** Skewness, kurtosis
- **Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, Q-Q plots

### 2. Probability Fundamentals
- **Axioms of probability**
- **Conditional probability:** P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)
- **Bayes' Theorem:** Foundation for Naive Bayes, Bayesian inference
- **Independence** vs correlation

### 3. Probability Distributions
| Distribution | Use Case | Parameters |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **Normal** | Continuous data, CLT | μ, σ |
| **Binomial** | Binary outcomes (n trials) | n, p |
| **Poisson** | Count data, rare events | λ |
| **Exponential** | Time between events | λ |
| **Uniform** | Equal probability | a, b |

### 4. Statistical Inference
- **Sampling:** Random, stratified, cluster
- **Point estimation:** MLE, method of moments
- **Interval estimation:** Confidence intervals
- **Hypothesis testing:** Null vs alternative, p-values
- **Type I & II errors:** α, β, power

### 5. Regression & Correlation
- **Correlation:** Pearson, Spearman
- **Linear regression:** OLS, assumptions
- **R² and adjusted R²**
- **Residual analysis**

### 6. ML-Relevant Statistics
- **Bias-variance tradeoff**
- **Cross-validation** (statistical view)
- **Bootstrap** for confidence intervals
- **Central Limit Theorem** — why it matters for inference
